            We know coming to a wedding is expensive, so please don't feel
            obligated to get us a gift. We've been living in sin for years,
            so we don't need any gifts. But if you do want to get us something
            anyway, you can gift us experiences for our honeymoon at Prezola 
            at the website linked below: 
        </div> 
        <a href="https://prezola.com/wishlists/10291412/" style={{padding: '10px' }}>https://prezola.com/wishlists/10291412/</a>
