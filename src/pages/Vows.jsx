        <h3>Mike's vows</h3>
        <p>
          Tabitha, tabby, toobz, tabz, tabitz; I love you - my life is better with you.
        </p> 
        <p>I’ve always struggled with speaking sincerely, - which is why the first draft of these vows was a 5 minute Wizard of Oz metaphor, that one was partially on you, you shouldn’t have allowed me full creative control. Luckily for you I’ve edited that out.
        </p>
        <p>When I proposed, I’d heard some advice not to ‘overprepare’ what I was going to say and just to go from the heart. This was a big mistake, I’m so glad that you:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>A - Eventually understood I was trying to propose to you and stopped responding to every line in my quote unquote speech.
          </li>
          <li>B - Still said yes. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Anyway, that’s a lesson learned, so for these vows I’ve honestly overcorrected and tried my best to express the way I feel about you in words.
        </p>
        <p>Tabs, I’m so lucky I met you. You are beautiful, intelligent, kind, a fierce competitor, but never a sore loser (which is good, cause there’s already one of those in the family). Your smile never fails to cheer me up, and the withering stare you’ve developed since becoming a teacher never fails to chill me to my very core. You’re the first person I want to tell good news to, even if you don’t understand why Saka getting a yellow card and dropping out of the bonus points constitutes ‘good news’.
        </p>
        <p>You’re a formidable pub quizzer, an amazing skier and a damn hard worker. You're an absolute catch and I’ll be forever grateful that I happened to move into a flat within the 1 mile radius you’d set your tinder profile to.
        </p>
        <p>Anyway, so far I haven't made any actual vows! So here we go:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>I promise to support you in the 10 million hobbies and jobs you have.
          </li>
          <li>I promise to let you be passenger princess more often than not.
          </li>
          <li>I promise to keep bringing you flowers and to keep your birthday presents a surprise.
          </li>
          <li>I promise to be respectful, patient, and loving towards you.
          </li>
          <li>I promise to do my very best to let you vent when you need to vent, even if I’ve got a burning desire to give advice that you’ve probably already thought of and definitely don’t need to hear.
          </li>
          <li>And finally, I promise to stand by your side, in sickness, in health, in the mud and dark in sherwood forest, when we went the wrong way and got my poor little limp mode ford fiesta stuck, in crowds at concerts even if we might have our phones stolen, I’ll stand by you until I can’t stand, I’ll love you until the day I die, if the boffins at NASA or whoever it is figure out a way for us to live 1000 years, it would be 1000 years of loving you.
          </li>
        </ul>   
        <h3>Tabitha's vows</h3>
        <p>From that very first date I knew how much I liked you. I’d lined up a string of dates for those couple of weeks, but after getting home from that date I messaged them all to cancel, saying I had met someone I really liked, and didn’t want to meet anyone else. Ever since then my love for you has grown every day.</p>
        <p>You’ve been there for me through the absolute worst times of my life, but have also helped to create some of the best times of my life, and I can’t wait to make beautiful memories with you in the future.</p>
        <p>You have changed me for the better, I am calmer, kinder, more patient, more thoughtful, more empathetic, less stubborn and more thrifty since meeting you, and I feel like I have become the person I was always meant to be with you by my side.</p>
        <p>I love how kind, generous and thoughtful you are. You always think about me and my feelings above everything. I feel cared for and loved every day, and I hope you feel the same love from me, even when I’m being a grumpy bitch.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>I promise to never stop telling you how much I love you and how much you mean to me.</li>
          <li>I promise to celebrate the good times with you, and work with you through the difficult times.</li>
          <li>I promise to appreciate our differences as well as our similarities, to accept you as you are, just as you accept me, because we complement each other perfectly.</li>
          <li>I promise to be patient with you when I want to make a crazy spontaneous decision and you want to check 100 reviews, read dozens of reddit articles and mull it over for days before making a decision.</li>
          <li>I promise to always communicate with you, to listen to your views, to be honest with you, and to always be a team.</li>
          <li>I promise to love you until the day that I die.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You make me so happy, every day is better with you in my life and I’m so excited to spend forever with you.</p>
